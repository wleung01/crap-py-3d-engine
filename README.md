# crap-py-3d-engine
A place for me to slowly learn how to create a slow python-based OpenGL 3D rendering engine using MODERN Open GL 
(Apparently GLES 2.0 API) as per Nicolas P. Rougier's online book:

Many thanks goes to Nicolas for their efforts as it is very difficult to find good examples of programmer-pipeline tutorials. Nicolas' glumpy package is also quite good, but I will avoid using it here as I'd like to experience the low-level programming myself.

http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/ has also been a good resource, but I got a bit lost after the cube tutorials.
