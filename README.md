# crap-py-3d-engine
A place for me to slowly learn how to create a slow 3D rendering engine.

I plan to start learning basic low level openGL api sticking with the out-of-date GLUT wrapper.

And I plan to start parsing a COLLADA File, progressively supporting new features until the model and it's associated animation can be shown.
